A project intended to replicate the sketchpad/etch-n-sketch on a browser utilizing html, css, and javascript/jquery.

Pre-project Thoughts: Seems intimidating. We'll see how it turns out.

Post-project Thoughts: Overall, it was a lot of fun designing this sketchpad. I feel I spent too much time going down rabbit holes trying to find any way to make what I wanted to do possible. A few of these ideas turned out to be too big for the scope of this project. Such as having a border radius on the corners, no matter the size of the grid. Also, correctly adding 10% of black to a square, even if it already had a color in it. I didn't want to reset the square to white and go to black. I wanted to actually decrease the lighting of the square, while keeping the existing hue and saturation. I will probably come back and try and implement these ideas later on, but for now, I'm calling it finished.
